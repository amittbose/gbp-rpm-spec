Description: Python client for Openstack Group Based Policy
 Group Based Policy (GBP) provides declarative abstractions for achieving
 scalable intent-based infrastructure automation. This package provides the
 client/CLI support for that abstraction.
 .
 GBP complements the OpenStack networking model with the notion of policies
 that can be applied between groups of network endpoints. As users look beyond
 basic connectivity, richer network services with diverse implementations and
 network properties are naturally expressed as policies. Examples include
 service chaining, QoS, path properties, access control, etc.
 .
 GBP allows application administrators to express their networking requirements
 using a Group and a Policy Rules-Set abstraction. The specifics of policy
 rendering are left to the underlying pluggable policy driver.
 .
 GBP model also supports a redirect operation that makes it easy to abstract
 and consume complex network service chains and graphs.
